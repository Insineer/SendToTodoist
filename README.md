# Send to Todoist

> A tiny Telegram bot that turns your messages and forwards into Todoist tasks â€” instantly.

## Why
Tasks and requests often arrive via Telegram. Instead of copy-pasting into Todoist, just forward the message to the bot â€” it becomes a task you can triage later.

## What it does

- **Create tasks from any message or forward**  
- **Merge multiple forwards into one task** and keep original authors for context  
- **Send to Inbox by default** (you can choose another project in settings)  
- **One-step setup** â€” log in once and youâ€™re good to go  
- **Privacy-first** â€” doesnâ€™t store or log your messages or task data; everything is discarded immediately after sending to Todoist

> **Scope:** works in a **private chat with the bot** (no groups/channels).

## Getting started

1. Open **[@SendToTodoistBot](https://t.me/SendToTodoistBot)** and tap **Start**.  
2. Tap **Log in with Todoist** and authorize access.  
3. Send a message â€” it appears in your Todoist as a task.  
4. To capture incoming requests, **forward** messages to the bot.  
5. (Optional) Open **Settings** in the bot to change the target project from **Inbox**.

## Usage tips

- **Batch capture:** select multiple messages in Telegram and forward them all at once â€” the bot can **merge them into a single task** and preserve authors for context.  
- **Quick notes:** send yourself a short idea or reminder; it lands in Todoist to triage later.  
- **Project routing:** if you prefer a specific project instead of Inbox, change it for the next task and press "Set as Default"

## Privacy & data handling

- **No message storage:** the bot does **not** store or log message text or task content.  
- **Stateless by design:** payloads are relayed to Todoist and **discarded immediately**.  
- **Minimum necessary data:** to function, the bot keeps only whatâ€™s required to send tasks (e.g., your Telegram user ID and a Todoist access token).  
- **No analytics on task content.**

> This is an **unofficial integration**. Doist/Todoist are not affiliated with this project.

## Limitations

- Works in **private chat** with the bot (not in group chats or channels).  
- Works with text only, ignores any media formats.
- Subject to Todoist API limits and policies.
